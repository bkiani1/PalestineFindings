   	<h2>What is Censorship?</h2>
    <p>- According to  <a href ="https://www.aclu.org/other/what-censorship" target="_blank"> ACLU.org </a> Censorship, is the suppression of words, people, images, or ideas that are "offensive," and happens whenever some people succeed in imposing their personal political or moral values on others. </p>

<p>- Censorship can also be described as suppression of speech, public communication, or other information. Censorship can even be on social media. This form of censorship is tend to be called social censorship. Over here in the states we understand censorship as what was described above. But in some nations it is not just the "ideas" or "speech" that is being censored but the people themselves are as well. This page will explain and shed light on how the Palestinians have been censored and suppressed from the world and there neighbors. </p>
    <h2>Censorship from the outside  </h2>
    <p>- Censorship can occur even from the outside walls of palestine. An example of this from Zoom. we all know Zoom as the online service bringing us together for online learning. But on september 2020, Zoom had done a very controversial act of censorship by taking Leila Khaled, a Palestinian activist,  out of a online event that had invited many speakers.</p>
     <p> - Khaled, who has long spoken in solidarity with liberation movements worldwide, was one of several speakers set to participate in a seminar on gender and resistance narratives at SFSU, a public university. But the seminar became the target of a coordinated campaign by pro-Israel groups, which pressured both the university and Zoom to cancel it. Due to the pressure, Zoom had argued to the SFU officials that the seminar might have violated federal laws and therefore the companys terms of service, by providing support for terrorism. Zooms action was also followed by Facebook and other big tech companies, who had removed the live stream link. When asked, Zoom had declined to explain which anti-terrorism law would have applied, nor how the SFSU event would have violated it. This form of censorship is common in the western world towards the Palestinian people, as it seems they're voices are shut down even in the form of public activists.  </p>

  	<h2>Supporting Palestine is Anti-Semitic</h2>
    <p>- The supporting of Palestine and/or the idea of the right to return for Palestinians is often viewed as an act of anti-Semitic which leads to a censored and misinformed act of support. There has been many times where activists, celebrities, people in higher positioning, and/or anyone who chooses to support Palestine had been shut down because they are viewed of being anti-Semitic.
    But what is anti-Semitic, and what does it mean?    </p>
    <br>
    <p> - According to <a href="https://www.adl.org/anti-semitism" target="_blank"> ADL.com, </a> Anti-semitism is defined as The belief or behavior hostile toward Jews just because they are Jewish. It may take the form of religious teachings that proclaim the inferiority of Jews, for instance, or political efforts to isolate, oppress, or otherwise injure them. With this understood, we can elaborate more on where the idea/act of supporting Palestine can become falsely categorized as Anti-Semitic and thus being censored. Many Jewish followers, or even people who are not as much educated on the topic between Israeli and Palestine believe that supporting for the right to return to Palestine for the Palestinians is Anti-Semitic because they interpert that it is attacking the Jewish people. This is not the case, the act of supporting Palestine is mainly to fight back the occupation of Israel so Palestinians can have there homeland and be equal as the Jewish. It is not to inflict any harm on the religion of the Jewish people. Misinterpretations cause false narrations and just as in this case which can lead to being shut down or censored. There have been many times where people who are supporting Palestine have been shut down and censored.    </p>
    <p> An example of this can be with Palestinian singer Mohammad  Assaf who had won "Arab Idol" in 2013.  Assaf became very popular for his patriotic pro Palestine music, which led him to become a Goodwill ambassador for peace by the United Nations-agency for Palestinians refugees, or  UNRWA. But recently Israel has imposed a travel ban on Muhammad which revokes his entry permit that he earned as an UNRWA ambassador. Israel Likud party member, Avi Dichter reported to Maariv newspaper, that the decision to revoke Assaf permit was because his music was "calling for a struggle against Israel". Assaf is currently resided in the UAE, and it is reported by Dichter that Israel is working with the UAE in examining the possibility of preventing Assaf's artistic activities there. This comes after the UAE and Israel signed a deal on September 15 2020 to normalize relations, which many thought to be controversial. </p>

<h2>Censoring the Roots </h2>
<p> - It has also been reported that the Palestinians culture and homes are being torn away, destroyed and replaced for more Israeli interests. Israel is known to remove or evict Palestinians out of there houses so that new Jewish settlers can occupy that land or home. It seems that the Israeli government does not wish to have Palestinians living in the Israeli occupying area, even though they have been there before Israel had become a state. By doing this, slowly the people of Palestine's voices are being censored and leaving them to be suppressed to the curb.</p>

<p> -According too <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/04/931379662/israel-uses-cover-of-us-election-to-destroy-palestinian-homes-critics-say" target="_blank"> NPR.org, </a> during the U.S elections, Israeli authorities demolished a rural Palestinian hamlet in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday, residents and rights advocates said.

More than 70 structures were destroyed, making it the largest single demolition in the past decade and the biggest forced displacement of Palestinians in the West Bank in over four years, the United Nations said. The statement said 73 people — including 41 children — lived in what it called a "herding community. </p>
<p> - This was not the first time such acts have been committed against the Palestinian people. The video below will show Israeli police evicting a family back in February 2019. </p>
